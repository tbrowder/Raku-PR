A preferred construct is to have a shirtprogram (or script) which calls subrotines and classes defined in modules.

That results in "precompilation" of the code in the module. Several benefits of that are:

+ most important is the tremendous increase in speed
+ an additional benefit is the ability
  to extract certain details of the module
