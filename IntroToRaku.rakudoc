=head1 Background

[Optional. Is there any background to this
article that may be useful such as an
introduction to the basic ideas presented?]

I am a long-time, journey-man programmer.
I first learned FORTRAN IV as a first-semester
freshman in 1961. I immediately loved computer
programming, even though the write, run, debug
cycle was really long until we got access later to
using the IBM punch card machines ourselves! Then,
with some effort, we could get throughput in
less than a day. Evening and nights were great
because the mainframe was manned 24/7, so
it was almost like having one's own computer.

Much later in life, in 1988 after a 22-year career as
a USAF fighter pilot, I got a job as an analyst 
with a DoD contractor where I was able to use
my FORTRAN programming skills to good use.
Unfortunately, I failed to look into Perl when
it was first introduced in late 1987 and I heard
about it in mid-1988 from an intern at the main-frame help
desk on Eglin AFB, Florida.
 
Later, I was introduced to Perl 4 which was a God-send
because of its wonderful string-handling ability
and also its capability as a glue-language to
ease running other executables like shell and 
compiled FORTRAN programs. With Perl I could write
a program to run a series of a FORTRAN program on a government
super computer as batch job iterating over 180-plus
input sets which took days to complete and generated
multi-Mb data sets for postprocessing. Then separate
Perl programs converted the data into EPS drawings
and other artifacts to be included in project final 
reports.


=head1 Using the code

First of all, I favor C-style laguages, and Perl and Raku are examples of such.
I love many things about Raku, but these really
are handy, especially for two-fingered, non-touch
typists like me:

=item minimal requirement for parentheses

=begin code
# Perl
if ($a eq 'ab') { $b = "cd" }
# Raku
if $a eq 'ab' { $b = "cd" }
=end code

=item kebab-cased identifiers (goodbye underscore, I hardly knew ye!)
=begin code
my $is-night = True;
my $a'b = 0;
=end code

=item consistent sigil use compared to Perl

=item everything is an object

=item ease of class definition
=begin code 
=end code

=item introspection



For this short introduction to Raku, let me
show two examples of its introspection
capabilities.
